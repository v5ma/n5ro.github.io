GLBanireverse: The GLTF GLB Animation Mixer Reversible Control Example" controls GLTF animations in A-Frame with the ability to reverse the animations based on their current playback state.

This solves an issue posted several times to A-Frame Extras

"Hi there and thank you for your great work!

I tried to trigger a gltf animation and then reverse it. Triggering the animation works. But the backward direction doesn't work.

It seems, several people had this issue in the past (#364).

I've created a glitch demonstrating the problem: https://glitch.com/edit/#!/thoracic-typhoon-rest

You can click "forward" and it works just fine, "backward" doesn't work unfortunately. Or am I doing something wrong?

Thanks in advance and let me know if anything is missing to reproduce the issue." https://github.com/c-frame/aframe-extras/issues/446

Explanation of Why This Approach Works:

Targeted Control of Animation Playback:

Conditional Playback Start: Each button's functionality is triggered conditionally based on the animation's current time (action.time). This ensures that the forward animation only starts if the animation is exactly at the beginning (time = 0), and the backward animation only starts if it is at the end (time = action.getClip().duration). This conditionality prevents inappropriate playback direction changes that could disrupt the animation flow or user experience.

Direct Manipulation of Animation Properties:

TimeScale Adjustment: The use of timeScale allows for straightforward control over the direction of the animation playback. Setting timeScale to 1 plays the animation forward, and setting it to -1 plays it backward. This direct manipulation provides clear and intuitive control over the animation.

Time Setting: For backward animation, setting action.time to action.getClip().duration ensures that the playback starts from the end, making the reversal visually coherent and correct.

Utilization of A-Frame's Animation Mixer:

Robust Integration with A-Frame: By using A-Frame's built-in animation-mixer component, which is part of the aframe-extras package, the implementation leverages robust, tested mechanisms for animation control within the A-Frame ecosystem. This integration ensures compatibility and reliability.

Clamp When Finished: The use of clampWhenFinished: true in the animation mixer setup ensures that when an animation completes, it holds at its last frame rather than resetting. This is crucial for the backward animation functionality, as it ensures the animation remains at the end before a reverse playback is initiated.

Solving the Original Problem:

The original problem involved ensuring that animations could be played forward and backward from their respective starting points on demand. The core issues to address were:

Ensuring animations play only from correct positions (start or end).
Managing direction changes seamlessly without user-perceived bugs or glitches.
The solution provided solves these problems by:

Implementing conditional checks to ensure animations start only from their designated starting points.
Using timeScale for straightforward direction control and manually setting time for accurate initiation of backward play.

Conclusion:

The "GLTF Animation Mixer Reversible Control Example" or "GLBanireverse" effectively manages and controls the direction of GLTF animations within an A-Frame environment, providing a user-friendly, intuitive interface for interaction. This setup not only enhances user engagement by allowing dynamic control over animation playback but also ensures the animation state is always appropriate for the intended action, thus maintaining the integrity and continuity of the visual experience.
